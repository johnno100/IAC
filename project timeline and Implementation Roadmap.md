- [ ] Deploy Node Exporters on all hosts
- [ ] Create initial monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Deploy Uptime Kuma for basic uptime monitoring

## Phase 3: AI Services (Week 3)

### Day 15-16: Database and Storage Setup

- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL for AI services
- [ ] Set up volume management for AI data
- [ ] Implement backup procedures for databases
- [ ] Test restoration procedures

### Day 17-19: OpenWebUI Deployment

- [ ] Deploy OpenWebUI containers
- [ ] Configure Traefik integration
- [ ] Set up Authentik integration
- [ ] Implement automated tests

### Day 20-21: AI Service Optimization

- [ ] Fine-tune resource allocation
- [ ] Set up monitoring for AI services
- [ ] Configure alerting for AI service issues
- [ ] Document AI service architecture

## Phase 4: Infrastructure Documentation and Governance (Week 4)

### Day 22-23: Netbox Configuration

- [ ] Deploy Netbox for infrastructure documentation
- [ ] Import inventory into Netbox
- [ ] Document network topology
- [ ] Configure Netbox integrations

### Day 24-25: HashiCorp Vault Implementation

- [ ] Deploy HashiCorp Vault
- [ ] Configure secrets management
- [ ] Integrate Vault with Ansible
- [ ] Set up access policies

### Day 26-28: Documentation and Handover

- [ ] Complete MkDocs documentation
- [ ] Create operational runbooks
- [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Conduct knowledge transfer sessions

## Ongoing Maintenance Plan

### Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Review monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Check backup execution status
- [ ] Update documentation for any changes
- [ ] Review system logs for issues

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Test backup restoration
- [ ] Review security configurations
- [ ] Apply system updates
- [ ] Capacity planning review

### Quarterly Tasks

- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Architecture review

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **High Availability**: T440 is successfully integrated into a Proxmox cluster with your existing node
2. **Service Deployment**: All required services are deployed and functional
3. **Authentication**: Single sign-on is implemented across all services
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting is in place
5. **Documentation**: Complete documentation is available for all components
6. **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup procedures are implemented and tested
7. **Security**: All services are secured according to best practices
8. **Performance**: Resource utilization is optimized across both nodes

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Hardware failure | High | Cluster setup provides redundancy |
| Data loss | High | Implement 3-2-1 backup strategy |
| Security breach | High | Follow zero-trust principles, regular security audits |
| Network issues | Medium | Redundant networking, monitoring |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Careful capacity planning, monitoring |
| Knowledge gaps | Medium | Comprehensive documentation, training |
| Implementation delays | Low | Phased approach, flexible timeline |

## Post-Implementation Review

Two weeks after completing the implementation, conduct a review to:

1. Evaluate actual performance against success criteria
2. Identify any outstanding issues or improvements
3. Gather feedback from users and administrators
4. Update documentation based on practical experience
5. Plan for future enhancements

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing your infrastructure, with clear phases, tasks, and success criteria. Adjust the timeline as needed based on your team's availability and any unforeseen challenges.
